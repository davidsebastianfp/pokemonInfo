To run the project locally
---------

1. Download the pokeinfo.zip file and unzip the file
2. Open the folder from android studio. 
3. Run flutter clean command.
4. Finally run the project.

**NOTE** To login use test@test.com as email and test12345 as password.
**NOTE** For this project, I used flutter 1.20.4 sdk version

Why did I choose the packages used in pubspeck.yaml
-------
1. I used shared_preferences to save the login and first open stutus in the device.
2. I used http package to get info from the pokemo API.
3. The flutter_spinkit is used to show the loading page when I'm fetching data from the server
